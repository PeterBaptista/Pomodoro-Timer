# Pomodoro-Timer

The Pomodoro Timer project is a web application designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro technique. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals, typically 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. The aim of this technique is to improve focus and productivity by taking regular breaks and avoiding burnout.

The Pomodoro Timer project is inspired by the design of the Pomofocus.io website but uses a unique codebase. The web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted on Github. The application has a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to start, pause, and reset the timer.

The application has the following features:

- Start, pause, and reset timer buttons
- Adjustable timer intervals for work and break sessions
- Audio and visual notifications at the end of each session
- (Working) Progress bar to show the remaining time of the current session
- (Working) A running log of completed sessions
- (Working) A settings panel to customize the timer intervals and notification sounds

The Pomodoro Timer project is open-source, and contributions from the community are welcome. Users can fork the project, make changes, and submit pull requests. The project is not currently licensed under the MIT license.

The goal of the project is to provide users with a simple and effective tool for time management. The project is suitable for students, professionals, and anyone looking to improve their productivity and focus. The Pomodoro Timer project is an excellent opportunity for developers to learn and practice web development skills.
